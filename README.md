# CodeAlpha – Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning  

This project was developed as part of my **Data Science internship at CodeAlpha**.  
It focuses on building a **regression model** to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features such as brand goodwill, horsepower, mileage, and more.  

---

##  Project Goal
- Predict the **selling price of used cars** using machine learning techniques.  
- Understand how different features (brand, horsepower, mileage, etc.) influence car prices.

##  What I Did
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Gathered car-related dataset.  
   - Handled missing values and removed inconsistencies.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Encoded categorical features.  
   - Normalized/standardized numerical features (if required).  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Built and trained **Regression models** (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor).  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Used metrics such as:  
     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
     - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**  
     - **R² Score**  

5. **Visualization**  
   - Plotted **Actual vs Predicted Prices** to assess model performance.

##  Key Libraries
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models & evaluation metrics  
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization  
- **Seaborn** – Statistical data visualization  

---

##  Future Enhancements
- Apply **hyperparameter tuning** for better accuracy.  
- Compare multiple regression models (e.g., XGBoost, Gradient Boosting).  
- Build an **interactive web app** (using Streamlit) for real-time price prediction.
